# Credit Risk Prediction — End-to-End ML Project

This project implements an **end-to-end credit risk prediction system** using multiple machine learning models:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier

The best-performing model (**XGBoost**) is deployed as a **production-ready FastAPI REST API** with a **Streamlit frontend** for interactive predictions.

---

## 🚀 Project Highlights
- Multiple ML models trained and evaluated
- End-to-end preprocessing using `ColumnTransformer`
- Robust handling of missing values and categorical variables
- Model comparison and selection based on performance
- Production-ready deployment using FastAPI
- Interactive frontend using Streamlit
- Safe JSON serialization and version-consistent deployment

---

## 🧠 Models Used

### 1️⃣ Logistic Regression
- Baseline interpretable model
- Useful for understanding feature influence
- Helps benchmark performance against complex models

### 2️⃣ Random Forest Classifier
- Ensemble-based tree model
- Captures non-linear relationships
- Provides feature importance insights

### 3️⃣ XGBoost Classifier (Final Model)
- Gradient boosting model with superior performance
- Handles complex feature interactions effectively
- Selected for deployment due to best overall metrics

---

## 📊 Model Training & Selection
All models were trained on the same preprocessed dataset and evaluated using classification metrics such as:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- ROC-AUC

**XGBoost** achieved the best trade-off between recall and precision and was therefore selected for deployment.

## ⚠️ Deployment Notes

The deployed model is a single serialized pipeline (preprocessing + model)

OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown="ignore") prevents inference crashes

NumPy outputs are converted to native Python types for JSON safety

scikit-learn version consistency is required between training and deployment

##  Future Improvements

Deploy Logistic Regression and Random Forest as optional inference models

Add model comparison dashboard

Dockerize full application

Add CI/CD and automated testing

Add monitoring for data drift

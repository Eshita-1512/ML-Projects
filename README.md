# ML Projects — Eshita

This repository contains a curated collection of my machine learning projects and algorithm solutions. Each project folder contains notebooks, code, and deployment artifacts where applicable.

## Featured projects
- **Credit Risk Prediction** — End-to-end XGBoost credit risk scoring pipeline with preprocessing, model serialization, FastAPI inference service and Streamlit frontend. See `CREDIT_RISK/`.  
- **DSA_in_cpp** — Data structures & algorithms solutions in C++ for problem solving and interviews.  
- **API** — (Short description of the API repo if relevant)

## Quicklinks

## About me
I build production-ready ML systems, deploy inference services and create user-friendly frontends for model interaction. I enjoy turning notebooks into reliable, maintainable code.
